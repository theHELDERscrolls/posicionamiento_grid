        <h1>STOICISM</h1>
        <p>
            Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy that flourished in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. The
            Stoics believed that the practice of virtue is enough to achieve eudaimonia: a well-lived life.

        <h3>Philosophical system:</h3>
        <p>
            Of all the schools of ancient philosophy, Stoicism made the greatest claim to being utterly systematic. In
            the view of the Stoics, philosophy is the practice of virtue, and virtue, the highest form of which is
            utility, is generally speaking, constructed from ideals of logic, monistic physics, and naturalistic ethics.
